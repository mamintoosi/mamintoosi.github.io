We are excited to announce that we have started to use **[Just the Class](https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/)**, a modern, highly customizable, responsive Jekyll template for course websites. Just the Class is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. It provides a boilerplate for announcements, a course calendar, a staff page, and a weekly schedule. It also supports plain web pages and files. Just the Class is used by many universities such as Stanford and Berkeley for their courses. You can see some examples of courses using Just the Class at [https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/](https://kevinl.info/just-the-class/). You can also see our courses at [https://fumcs.github.io/courses/](https://fumcs.github.io/courses/). We encourage you to check out Just the Class and see how it can help you create beautiful and functional course websites.
