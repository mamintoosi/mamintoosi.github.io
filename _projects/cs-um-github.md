We have recently updated the computer science bachelor program of our university and published it on our blog. To create the program, we used a Python script to extract the courses information from a Word file and generate Markdown files for each lesson. Then, we used **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**, a fast and simple static site generator that can create beautiful project documentation from Markdown files. We hosted the documentation on **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**, a free service that can serve static websites from GitHub repositories. You can find the resulting documentation at [http://cs-um.github.io/docs/](http://cs-um.github.io/docs/). 

You can access the script from [this repository](https://github.com/mamintoosi/mkdocs-base).

We hope you enjoy our new program and find it useful.
