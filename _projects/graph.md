Graphs are one of the most important and versatile data structures in computer science. They can model complex relationships between data items, such as networks, hierarchies, dependencies, similarities, and more. Graphs can also capture various properties of data, such as direction, weight, distance, and connectivity.

Graphs have many applications in different domains of computer science, such as:

- Graph matching: Finding a subset of edges in a graph that matches a given set of vertices or criteria. Graph matching can be used for tasks such as image registration, object recognition, face detection, and pattern recognition.
- Laplacian of graph: A matrix that represents the degree of connectivity and similarity between vertices in a graph. Laplacian of graph can be used for tasks such as spectral clustering, dimensionality reduction, graph embedding, and graph partitioning.
- Graph in biology: Using graphs to model biological phenomena, such as gene networks, protein interactions, metabolic pathways, phylogenetic trees, and neural networks.
- Graph neural networks: A type of neural network that operates on graph-structured data. Graph neural networks can learn from both the features and the structure of graphs, and can be used for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, graph generation, and graph representation learning.
<!-- - Graph in computer vision: Using graphs to represent images or scenes, and applying graph algorithms to solve computer vision problems, such as segmentation, object detection, scene understanding, and image synthesis. -->

Here, we will share some of our works in the area of graph theory and its applications. We will show how graphs can help us understand and solve various problems in computer science. We hope you will find these works interesting and useful.
