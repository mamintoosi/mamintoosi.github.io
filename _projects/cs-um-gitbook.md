We have updated the computer science bachelor program of our university and shared it on our blog. We wrote a Python script to get the courses information from a Word file and make Markdown files for each lesson. You can access the script from [this repository](https://github.com/mamintoosi/mkdocs-base). Then, we used **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**, a simple and fast tool that can build project documentation from Markdown files. We used **[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)**, a modern documentation platform that supports any form of rich text, programming languages and visual assets, to publish the documentation. You can see it at [http://cs-um.gitbook.io/curr/](http://cs-um.gitbook.io/curr/). 
We hope you like our new program and find it helpful.
