Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the environment. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to extract information from images or videos, mimicking human visual perception capabilities. Computer vision finds application in various domains such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, medical imaging, and more. Some notable examples of computer vision include:

- Super Resolution: Super resolution techniques aim to enhance the resolution of an image beyond its inherent limits. By utilizing deep-learning models, these algorithms can generate clear, high-quality images from low-resolution inputs, enabling improved analysis and visual perception.

- Image Registration: Image registration methods are employed to align different images or frames of the same scene, enabling comparisons and further analysis. This technique is commonly used in medical imaging to align pre-operative and intra-operative images, enabling accurate visualization and diagnosis.

- Object Detection: Object detection algorithms enable efficient and accurate identification and localization of objects within images or videos. These techniques play a significant role in self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and image retrieval tasks, aiding in the recognition and tracking of objects of interest.

- Image Blending: Image blending involves combining multiple images seamlessly, eliminating any visible abrupt transitions. This technique finds applications in panorama stitching, where multiple images of a scene are combined to create a wide-angle view or immersive experience.

- Image Matting: Image matting techniques focus on separating foreground objects from the background in an image, enabling accurate object extraction and realistic image composition. It finds applications in image editing, virtual reality, and augmented reality, facilitating various visual effects and manipulations.

- Facial Expression: Facial expression analysis focuses on recognizing and interpreting emotions and expressions from facial images or videos. Using computer vision techniques, it becomes possible to detect and classify facial expressions, enabling applications in emotion recognition systems, human-computer interaction, and social robotics.

Computer vision techniques continue to evolve and play a vital role in enabling machines to perceive and understand visual data, contributing to advancements in numerous fields.
