Soft computing is a branch of computer science that deals with system solutions based on artificial intelligence and natural selection. Soft computing techniques are able to handle imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation, which are often encountered in real-life problems. Soft computing techniques are also adaptive, learning from data and experience, and can cope with dynamic and complex environments.

Soft computing includes various methods, such as:

- Genetic algorithm (GA): A population-based optimization method that mimics the process of natural evolution. GA works by generating and evaluating candidate solutions using operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Neural network (NN): A computational model that simulates the structure and function of biological neurons. NN works by processing information through layers of interconnected nodes that can learn from data and adjust their weights accordingly.
- Fuzzy logic (FL): A logic system that allows for degrees of truth rather than binary values. FL works by using fuzzy sets and rules to represent and reason with vague and uncertain information.
- Evolutionary algorithms (EA): A type of meta-heuristic algorithm that are inspired by the process of natural evolution. They work by maintaining a population of candidate solutions that undergo selection, crossover, and mutation operators to generate new solutions. Some examples of evolutionary algorithms are differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization.

Soft computing has many applications in different domains of computer science, such as:

- Timetabling: The problem of assigning tasks or events to time slots and resources, such as classes to rooms and teachers. Soft computing can help to find feasible and optimal timetables that satisfy various constraints and preferences.
- Location problems: The problem of finding the best location for a facility or service, such as a warehouse, a hospital, or a fire station. Soft computing can help to find optimal locations that minimize costs, distances, or risks, while considering various factors and uncertainties.

Here, we will share some of our previous works in the area of soft computing and its applications. We will show how soft computing can help us solve various computer science problems that are challenging and complex. We hope you will find these works interesting and useful. Since a [separate post](https://fumcs.github.io/projects/deep-learning/) is considered for neural networks and deep learning, we omitted some of our NN works from here.
